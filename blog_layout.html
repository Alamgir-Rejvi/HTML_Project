            <h2>Future World By AI</h2>
            <h3>How will AI impact the future?</h3>
            <p> <h4>Speed of life.</h4> The most obvious change that many people will feel across society is an increase in the tempo of engagements with large institutions. Any                         organization that engages regularly with large numbers of users -- businesses, government units, nonprofits -- will be compelled to implement AI in the decision-making                    processes and in their public- and consumer-facing activities. AI will allow these organizations to make most of the decisions much more quickly. As a result, we will all                 feel life speeding up.

                <h4>Broad efficiency gains.</h4>Business enterprises will almost certainly be compelled to integrate and exploit generative AI to improve efficacy, profitability and,                      most immediately, efficiency. Corporations' duty to increase shareholder value and fear of falling behind competitors that integrate and deploy AI more aggressively will                  make for a virtually irresistible imperative: Fully embrace AI or see your investors turn bearish as peers pull ahead.
                
                <h4>End of privacy.</h4> Society will also see its ethical commitments tested by powerful AI systems, especially privacy. AI systems will likely become much more                          knowledgeable about each of us than we are about ourselves. Our commitment to protecting privacy has already been severely tested by emerging technologies over the last                   50 years. As the cost of peering deeply into our personal data drops and more powerful algorithms capable of assessing massive amounts of data become more widespread, we                  will probably find that it was a technological barrier more than an ethical commitment that led society to enshrine privacy.
              <h4>Human-AI teaming.</h4> Much of society will expect businesses and government to use AI as an augmentation of human intelligence and expertise, or as a partner, to one                   or more humans working toward a goal, as opposed to using it to displace human workers. One of the effects of artificial intelligence having been born as an idea in                       century-old science fiction tales is that the tropes of the genre, chief among them dramatic depictions of artificial intelligence as an existential threat to humans, are                 buried deep in our collective psyche. Human-AI teaming, or keeping humans in any process that is being substantially influenced by artificial intelligence, will be key to                 managing the resultant fear of AI that permeates society.</p>
